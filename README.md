# BASTION 

The goal of this projet was to create a little program in Java using physics.
I created a game playable by 2 players, where the goal is to destroy the enemy generator while defending yours.
The game calculates the bullets'trajectories, taking into account friction and wind. 

You can launch the game by doawloading the jar file and with `java -jar Bastion.jar`
